# What is this?

A tool to play with the simplest version of the flow field pathfinding algorithm.

The algorithm was created during the development of the rts game Supreme Commander 2.
Its goal is to efficiently compute path for a big number of agent.

## Features

* Draw cost on a map
* Set a destination
* Visualize the integration field
* Visualize the flow field

## Supported platforms

 * Supported: Windows, Linux
 
## Build

```text
git clone https://github.com/Ruddle/rustfield
cd rustfield
cargo run --release
```
